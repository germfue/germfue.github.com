# The return

The last 18 moths have been full of changes, and looking back I see that I stopped doing some of the things I enjoy
the most. Somehow adjusting took most of my energy and time. So this is my official return to experimenting on my
own with technology and as such, I wanted to come back to blogging too.

This time, I will share the details of a small project I was thinking about for a while.

# The future

Since the acquisition of [Github](https://github.com/)
by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com),
I am uncomfortable with the hosting of this blog. Another point of frustration is the use of Jekyll, which is clearly a
good tool but it always make me feel like an outsider. I am not a big fan of Ruby and I guess that thought sticks in
my mind. I guess it is time to address both topics!

There are the objectives of my little exercise:

- Use a new static site generator: I'd like to give a try to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
- Create new repository, probably in [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) as they strongly support open source.
- Migrate existing posts from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
- Host the static website in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)

I keep you posted!
