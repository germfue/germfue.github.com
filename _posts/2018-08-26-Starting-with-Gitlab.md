# Ubelievable, Gitlab
I tried yesterday night to open an account with [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), and the process couldn't be more
frustrating. They attempt to protect the registration process, and in the way they got it completely wrong.

# Domain blocking
Gitlab blocks specific domains, that are completely valid and accepted by competitors like Github. I am a satisfied
user of [33mail](https://33mail.com), a service that allows you to create on the fly aliases for your mail, and a great
tool to control the level of spam you receive. If a company sells my email address, I just block the alias and 
continue with my happy life.

As my first option was discarded, I tried to register with a [GMX](https://gmx.com) address, to find out that they
also block it!

Fortunately I managed to register with an address in my own domain, but why to make it so complicated? Other companies
would cancel accounts in case their users do not behave as intended, instead of trying to keep the bad guys out by
making the registering process more cumbersome.

# Astonishing lack of memory
Playing around I found out that once registered, I can switch my email address to any blocked domain. Funny non-sense.

# Useless Captcha
As I attempted to register 3 times, I had a chance to use their captcha as many times. The variation in the topics 
(store fronts and crosswalks) and pictures is very limited. At the end I had to click mostly on the same set of 
pictures, in different order.

Why to make domain blacklisting and then having such a terrible captcha? Not like this, Gitlab.
