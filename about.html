             <p>I am Germ√°n Fuentes Capella, a software engineer in a continuous journey looking for new challenges and personal development.</p>
             <p>I just started my last adventure, in a troubled time where the lack of privacy has become the currency we all pay with in the Internet.
                I want to help those that are most exposed, those that can't afford being exposed. </p>
             <p>This is why I am focused on bringing together journalists and their sources. I want to build the conditions for them to interact freely,
                to exchange information without many of the risks they need to take nowadays. This is only possible when the organization enabling
                such a interaction has no access neither to its contents nor to the identity of the source.
                </p>
                
                <p>Because there is no better trust than the one based on not needing to trust. </p>
